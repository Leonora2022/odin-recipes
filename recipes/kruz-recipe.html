    <h1>Kruz Recipes</h1>
    <p>There is a lot of thought and planning that goes into preparing a three course meal and a purpose for each course. <em>Kruz Recipes</em> are recipes updatedly taught by famous chefs globally and mainly describing
    how appetizer dishes are prepared.

     <p>The appetizer prepares your pallet for the main course.
        Or it can be a snack while you wait for dinner. Appetizers break up the meal and give you something to do while the food is prepared. Personally I love the appetizer round of a meal. It’s a small portion so the food can be fun and light with bolder flavors. Appetizers are great for trying new things and testing out foods you wouldn’t ordinarily eat. And they’re cheaper than the main course so making a mistake isn’t a big deal.

    <p><em>The main course is a much bigger choice because this is your dinner. The appetizer was just a sampling of the food to come. If you order something you don’t like the dinner will be ruined so most people don’t take as many chances here. It usually takes a longer time to prepare and eat a main course because it’s much larger.
        The main course is the actual big meal you’ll be eating like a steak, fish or pasta.

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add onion. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until softened. Add wine and mustard. Stir until combined. Cook for 2 minutes or until wine has evaporated. Transfer to a large bowl. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, remove string from pork. Unroll. Pat rind dry with paper towel. Score at 1cm intervals. Place pork, skin-side down, on board. Slice crossways through thickest part of the meat, being careful not to cut the whole way through. Open out to form 1 large piece.</li>
        <li>Add breadcrumbs, parsley and mint to onion mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 250C/230C fan-forced. Press stuffing over pork. Roll up to enclose. Tie with kitchen string at 3cm intervals to secure. Place on a lightly greased wire rack in a large flameproof roasting pan. Brush with oil and rub sea salt all over pork.</li>
        <li>Roast pork for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 180C/160C fan-forced. Roast pork for a further 1 hour 30 minutes or until juices run clear when a skewer is inserted into the centre. Transfer pork to a plate. Cover loosely with foil. Set aside for 10 minutes to rest.</li>
         <li><Meanwhile, make Honey mustard dressing: Place ingredients in a screw-top jar. Season with salt and pepper. Secure lid. Shake until honey dissolves./li>
         <li>Arrange watercress, peach and onion in a serving bowl. Drizzle with dressing. Slice pork and serve with peach salad.</li>
